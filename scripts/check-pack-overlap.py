"""Refuses an asset entry the base module and a toolchain pack both carry.

BundleTool rejects such a bundle outright, with one line naming the entry,
which is how a release tag can otherwise fail minutes before publishing:
the base runtime and the packs are filled by different download scripts,
and nothing compares them until the whole bundle exists. Each script knows
its own tree; this is the one place that knows both.

Run after the downloads that populate the trees. A check against an empty
pack would pass for the wrong reason, so a pack whose directory exists but
answers with nothing is refused rather than skipped.
